README Description:

The motivation of this project was to create a web page that is accessible for everyone including those with disabilities to better create good business and relation between those accessing this project and the business delivering the project to their audience. 

I built this project to create a codebase that abides by accessibility standards so that those with disabilities can have the resources like assistive technologies, screen readers, video captions, and even braille keyboards.

By doing this I am creating web accessibility, which delievers a higher rank in search engines like google as well as helps companies avoid litigations.

While carrying out this project I learned why web accessibility is important and how web accessibility creates better business. I also learned how to refractor existing code and how semantic structure can make a project easier to maintain and read.
